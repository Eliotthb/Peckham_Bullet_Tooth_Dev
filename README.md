> CGS Individual Project (Development)
  
This project was created by Eliott Herbert-Byrnes for UFCFBK-60-M - Commercial games studio as part of the Commercial Game Development MSc course 2021.

The learning which was used to create this project was provided by Sean Bradley @ [ThreeJS and TypeScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/threejs-tutorials/?referralCode=4C7E1DE91C3E42F69D0F)

When run, the project shows a 3D AAA Magnum Rhino 60DS and interactive UI, with OrbitControls included. 

It uses webpack-dev-server for the development build, and NodeJS with Express for production build.

Both server and client projects are written in TypeScript.
